"✅ Trip Verified |   Quick check in at Mumbai airport, with a friendly check in agent. No fast track seemed to be present at the airport and nothing was said at check in but security and immigration were both very quick. The lounge at Mumbai is a generic airport lounge used by all airlines. It’s actually fairly good, and being there for breakfast there were various Indian and international options, including an egg station for made to order eggs/omlettes, which was a really good option. Alcohol wise it wasn’t great, with the lounge offering fairly limited or poor options but providing a menu where you can pay for better quality products… the free wine offerings were pretty disgusting (and I’m not very fussy). The staff in the lounge are very attentive and will take orders at your seat for some food and drink options. Boarding was very quick and efficient. Welcome drink was only water/OJ apparently due to Indian regulations preventing them serving alcohol on the ground. Flight was very good as is consistent with my experience on club suite. Food was beautifully presented although the crab starter had very little flavour. Between the meal service and access to club kitchen I was well catered for. I particularly like the club kitchen for being able to grab a drink or a snack between meal service without having to bother the crew. Bathrooms stayed fairly clean through the flight. Outstanding cabin crew, Kelly, showed the very best of BA crew .. professional, efficient whilst also friendly, helpful and personable. I used the free messaging WiFi connectivity for club members.. it worked for basic messaging but picture messaging was apparently too much for it. I didn’t test the paid WiFi options. IFE offered a good selection but resolution of the video on the screen was fairly poor, and weirdly different to my outbound flight I could not find a search function for shows/films so had to look through the various lists to try to see the full content. The seat was really comfortable as always, as this was a day flight I didn’t attempt any sleep although I relaxed in various lounging positions very nicely. On the ground in Heathrow things were fairly tainted by the exceptionally slow return of luggage. Some bags started soon after the passengers reached the belt then there were sporadic additions of new bags every now and again with my priority bag coming about an hour after landing… approx 75% of the passengers still seemed to be waiting for their bags when I left.",2497,0.2537160470248705
"Not Verified |  Avoid the BA Cityflyer Embraers Flew from STN to FLR on Feb 8. Funny smell on the plane, which was quite unpleasant, seats rock hard and don't recline, limited legspace. The only plus points of the flight was the very cheap price, getting airbridged onto the plane (a rarity at Stansted) and the friendly enough crew. Also, these Embraers are based at London City.",380,0.016488095238095246
"✅ Trip Verified |   After a medical emergency abroad, I was forced to return to Canada and could not use my British Airways return flight from Rome. I notified the airline, provided documentation, and requested a credit for the unused return portion of the ticket. What followed was more than four months of deflection and obstruction. British Airways demanded medical documents, many of which were already provided, only to claim later that they were “not in the correct department” or “not attached to this case.” I received multiple AI-generated responses that did not address my situation at all. At times, replies were factually incorrect or unrelated to my case. Despite acknowledging my medical emergency, British Airways insisted on impossible or medically absurd requirements — such as retroactive certificates stating that I was “unable to fly”. British Airways claimed Expedia was responsible, while Expedia explicitly instructed me to deal with British Airways as the operating carrier. I was trapped in a circular loop where no one accepted responsibility. Even after confirming that my return flight was unused, British Airways continued to delay, request duplicate paperwork, and ultimately refused resolution.",1225,-0.007246376811594201
Not Verified |  This BA flight on 31 Jan was largely uneventful. The food service has deteriorated further. The seats in economy as uncomfortable as ever. BA crew are generally quite efficient but there's something very snooty and superior about BA staff which you don't see on many other airlines. It's hard to explain but it's almost as though they're there to do you a huge favour when in reality you're keeping them in a job and in many cases could fly with another airline. I've always resisted it when people have claimed this before but sadly I do believe it's true.,573,0.1641156462585034
"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked this flight using avios and a companion voucher so was exceptional value. The cash fare however would have seemed expensive. On a Sunday afternoon/early evening Heathrow T5 check in and security had little queue and I was through to the departure lounge very quickly. As my flight was going from B gates, I opted for the B Gate Galleries Lounge, which was calm and not too busy. Food offerings were fairly good, I had some soup and a chicken dish with mashed potatoes, followed by some pork pie snack. Drinks offerings as always were plentiful and easy to access. Boarding was fairly quick and I was immediately offered a welcome drink, I chose the champagne. My bedding, amenity kit, headphones and water bottle were waiting in my seat as usual. Seat and area were generally clean although crumbs can be seen in some of the crevices. I am a fan of the club suite, even though I wish the walls and door were higher more similar to the Qsuite of Qatar Airways. The seat is comfortable in take off, lounging and sleeping mode, and there is ample storage. After take off and a fair wait, drinks and a bag of snacks were served while we waited for our meal. The snacks really should be in a bowl rather than a bag. For the meal I enjoyed a tuna and avocado starter which was beautifully presented and very tasty. My main was a malai chicken curry with rice, daal and breads. Presentation was fine, annoyingly quite a bit of the rice was crunchy rather than cooked, but the taste of the dish was decent. For desert I opted for the cheese board, which was good but should come with a couple more crackers. I made use of the club kitchen for a couple more top ups of wine before bed - whilst some people would prefer to ring the call button the convenience of the club kitchen and being able to help yourself is easier and quicker in my opinion. IFE was fairly good although I had to search for movies that I knew were on there as they didn’t come up in any browsing option I could find, making it appear there was a much more limited selection than there actually was. The screen is big however the quality of the movies was actually quite low, more like old analogue tv rather than hd let alone 4k. Given the recent refits of these planes this is disappointing - not sure if it is hardware limitation of just the software / quality of the videos they’ve purchased. WiFi messaging is free for members of The Club.  I did not try the paid packages. I slept fairly well for 2-3hrs. The ‘mattress topper’ is fairly pointless but does at least create a clean area to sleep on not just the seat itself. The pillow is excellent and the blanket keeps you warm enough. Breakfast was a full English, fresh fruit and a coffee. All of which were actually very good. Overall the cabin crew were very good. As this was a night flight they were not very present through the night, but were professional and friendly during all of the service.",2950,0.239115925058548
"✅ Trip Verified |  Had a great time in lounge at Gatwick, a much nicer experience than Heathrow. A good flight with an above average cabin crew, unfortunately let down by the old style club world seats. The awful climbing over someone's legs to use the bathroom.",262,-0.0006172839506172818
"✅ Trip Verified | I have been flying with BA for many years now, and it has always been a premium and comfortable experience. However, my recent experience with them has shown a worrisome sign. First, we have to board the flight from the outdoor platform, which is common for cheaper budget flights. Second, the wifi is not working for this trip. Lastly, we are waiting on the flight for 20 mins.",396,0.12142857142857141
"✅ Trip Verified |   Every single aspect of my recent journey from Gatwick to Las Palmas had major flaws. I tried to check in at the Club check in and was turned back at the entrance to the Club check in as there were ""luggage issues"". Nowhere to go or sit, so I had to stand in the departures hall for 45 minutes which was very chilly and I was not dressed for the cold. Eventually checked in andwent through to the BA lounge which was really full and struggled to find two seats together. Then went down to board the plane and no priority boarding so had to join a long queue to access the plane. On the plane it became obvious pretty quickly that all the supplying for food and alcohol had gone badly wrong. The food item I wanted for my main course was finishied so i asked for a cheese board and some red primitivo wine. Then found out no Primitivo wine left. Nobody in rows 11 or 12 got their wine with their lunch  and by 14.23 (two hours into a four plus hour flight) the plane was out of ""still"" wine completely. The CSD was hugely apologetic but clearly it was not his mistake the plane did not have enough of anything. I had received a communication form BA recently proudly announcing the fact that the Internet would be available for free. Great but the internet went down after less than an hour and stayed off for the rest of the flight. Apparently this is pretty normal! We did land 20 minutes early which was great and then our luggage took ages to arrive on the conveyor belt. So much for priority luggage tags which clearly don't work very well. The crew were all lovely but it was a shocking waste of my money to pay for Club. I could have had the same journey for masses less money in economy .(or travelled on Ryanair)! I actually left the plane hungry. Regrettably I have already booked to do the same flight with BA again in April and am now regretting booking the flight. I could go on Ryanair / EasyJet for almost nothing and get almost nothing but save loads of money. I will not be booking any more flights with BA. When are BA executives going to learn that if you sell 15 plus rows of Club seats / you need the right number of staff and the right amount of food and alcohol - this is not the first experience I have had of exactly this situation on flights to and from Las Palmas.. In fact it has been pretty much the same experience every time I have travelled to or from Las Palmas.The return flight from Las Palmas to Gatwick can be much worse if there is no more food and wine loaded at Las Palmas which has happened. I don't normally bother to spend hours writing reports on my flights as I really have better things to do with my time, but this experience was definitely noteworthy. After escalating my complaint to the senior complaints team at BA , I was offered a small amount of Avios points as compensation for the really poor experience. I replied saying I thought this was underwhelming and got a reply saying they had no legal obligation to give me anything and this was a full and final gesture. I am now considering contacting my Credit Card company after I have flown back to Gatwick and asking for a charge back for non delivery of the promised services. Will be interesting to see where this goes to.",3248,0.07318576388888891
"✅ Trip Verified |  I have not used BA for 15 years and the experience was abysmal as before. The plane was one hour late departing because they are unable to prepare the plane in a competent manner. The seat was the most uncomfortable I have encountered in any European flight. The pitch is 29 inches meaning that if you are over 5 foot, 7 inches your knees will be forced into the seat in front.",396,-0.08571428571428573
"✅ Trip Verified | ​British Airways website wouldn't let me add a bag. Airport staff then demanded €1,300 for 20kg from Marseille to London. Called support and was told to pay it or leave your bag behind. They are using technical glitches to extort passengers.",259,-0.2
